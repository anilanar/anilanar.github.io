# Loud thinking...

Foreword: This post is total bullshit. Please ignore and move on with your life.

I was going to write a post that bashes Javascript and praises Typescript for being type-safe and saving the world.

I was going to talk about how Javascript development scene sucks compared to other scenes in web development such as Java (Spring), Scala, ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails or even PHP frameworks.

Then it came to me that it's not that easy to make such conclusions. But still, look at first two paragraphs of this post.

Let's assume that there are 5 boxes in front of you. Each box has a piece of code from a random project in universe in the given framework. Assign a number from 0 to 10: 0 means probability of it being a mess is hundred percent, 10 means that code is an absolute masterpiece for sure.

```markdown
- Javascript
- Some PHP framework
- Lift/Play (Scala)
- Spring (Java)
- Ruby on Rails
- Go
```

Javascript code is probably a mess. There is too much Javascript code in universe, random webpages for handling some jQuery event in an obscure/hacky way to make it work for all browsers. It having unit tests is very unlikely.

PHP is probably the next one in ascending order of messiness.

Then comes Java and Spring. Java language is verbose as hell, CPU bound runtime performance is terrible even though there have been tremendous optimizations over the years. But Spring is very opiniated as a framework. There is not much you can do to cuztomize the way it forces you to do things. Strong types, compile time errors help tremendously for having a more structured code than former languages. Spring is mostly used by medium-to-large sized businesses, which implies they have good chance of writing unit tests for their projects. Actually ASP.NET is similar to Spring in many respects so I didn't include it in the list.

Ruby on rails, then Scala and lastly Go. They are at the more elitist side of this whole scene. Elitist means they are more careful with what they do. Their opinions are more strictly followed. Opinion is structure. Structure helps to have better code.

Let's go back to 5 boxes. Now I want you to order them by popularity. Does the ordering look similar to the state when they are ordered by messiness? For me, it did. I hear you saying "this is the chicken and egg problem". I don't think it is.

I hear you saying Javascript must be used by everyone who does web development, including big corporations. They have unit tests and integration tests for every other language: For back-end, for embedded devices, for driver/kernel software, for Qt, C# Winforms, iOS and Android applications and whatnot. Why do they skip testing with Javascript? Because it's a culture that creeps the scene from good old jQuery days, why else?

(Oh wait. I'm not so sure about iOS and Android. I've seen very few codes and libraries that have tests.)

Then comes Typescript. I see it as a savior because a better development culture can grow with a new language.

Or maybe not. I might be wrong. I don't know. I'm tired.
