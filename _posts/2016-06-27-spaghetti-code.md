# Curse of spaghetti code

I quit my job. There are too many reasons I can give to you, but I think the primary reason was that I hit a brick wall when trying to hack into a spaghetti code, that is a curse upon a project.

## Spaghetti code

I'm sure there is a very good definition for spaghetti code out there. I'll give you my definition: the kind of code that prevents you from making estimations regarding:
* When you will complete a feature/bugfix/refactoring task
* Overall error-proneness of the piece of code you introduced

## Hope is lost

When you cannot make estimations for those, you lose hope. Usually there is no easy way to explain it to the person you report to. Your manager doesn't care if it's spaghetti code or not. What's done is done, there are customers waiting for that shiny new feature, promises have been made. You feel the tension and impatience in his voice. Not good.

Either you handle it, or the task should be assigned to someone else. You feel like you lost credibility, trustability and what not.

## Anger

Anger build-up is real. Spaghetti code does make you lose hope but that's not the only bad thing that happens. You get angry at the code because you spend much more time trying to hack into it than you would with a quality code. You become angry at your manager because he allows lousy code, your colleagues because they write lousy code and they allow it in code reviews.

## Company culture

These feelings creep into every employee. It becomes a company culture. No one cares anymore about what happens to the project 6 months later. Code is written for the day, tomorrow it may break. Tomorrow it may be impossible to add a new feature. As long as it works, we are good to go. This is an exaggeration, but it makes it easier for me to explain the direction company culture is going towards. It becomes unbearable for me after some time. It's like constantly fighting bureaucracy 7/24 to make world a better place. If I liked that kind of life, I would become a freaking politician!

## The end

I quit my job. I apply to other jobs and my sole criteria are overall quality of code and how hard developers working to make it better. And guess what, some company was looking for someone who has this exact criteria (or they sounded like they did to lure me in). Wish me luck!
